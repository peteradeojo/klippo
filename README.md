## About
Klippo is a secure cloud-storage and database platform that uses simple yet well-defined security practices to protect the information stored in our databases.

I hope to extends the functionality of this application in the nearest future. But for now, it remains a personal test of my abilities, and it helps me to implement things I've learned for better understanding.

Klippo was previously built in Vanilla JavaScript (view [here](https://github.com/peteradeojo/klippo/tree/vanilla)) but has now been completely rebuilt in TypeScript which means better code security and type safety.

## Contribution

Anybody is welcome to create issues, or better still, fork this repo and implement any features they want to see added to it. I don't have anything better to do so I might as well accept some pull requests (I promise I won't go through your code).

Frontend developers who are willing to impore the UI of the application are most welcome. You can also use the API Documentation to build your own standalone platform to integrate the API.

Refer me for jobs please üôèüèΩ.

Thanks
