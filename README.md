## About
Klippo is a secure cloud-storage and database platform that uses simple yet well-defined security practices to protect the information stored in our databases.

I hope to extends the functionality of this application in the nearest future. But for now, it remains a personal test of my abilities, and it helps me to implement things I've learned for better understanding.

Klippo was previously built in Vanilla JavaScript but has now been completely rebuilt in TypeScript which means better code security and type safety.
